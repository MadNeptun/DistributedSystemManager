Title:
	Distributed System Manager
Abstract:
	Purpose of this project is to create a basic set of tools for creation and administration for distributed
	networks. For scholar and demonstration purposes we should create classic window application that should
	allow to simulate behavior of distributed network: in this particular case message transmision between nodes.

Features (tools):
	# Creation of node, with given algorithm and network connection component.
	# 'Hot swap' of algorithm/neighborhood nodes/network connection component.
	# SDK for custom algorithm/network connection component.
	# Node multitasking (network should be able to process multiple init requests in same time).
Features (application):
	# Visual presentation of message transmision.
	# Set of predefined algorithms and network scheme.
	# Build-in network connection component for simulation purposes.
	# Creation of your own network.
Features (further plans):
	# Creation of parent node that will allow to host multiple nodes with diffrent algorithms.
	# Remote managment of child nodes over parent network (creation, algorithm swap, etc.).
